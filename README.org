#+TITLE: Kubernetes Sprites for PlantUML
#+STARTUP: inlineimages
A library of PlantUML sprites for Kubernetes, derived from the [[https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/icons][Kubernetes Community icons set]].
* Getting Started
This library provides two usages; as a "normal" spite tile on a =rectangle= object, and as a header on a "container" object (also implemented as a rectangle).
#+begin_example
K8S(alias, kind, label, color)
K8S_BOUNDARY(alias, kind, label, color)
#+end_example
In both cases "color" defaults to =#326ce5= (Kubernetes blue) and is optional.

Include the sprite definitions and =common.puml= following the example below.  This library follows the structure of the community icon library.Each directory has one =all.puml= file that includes all that directory's sprites.  =common.puml= defines the macros that use them.

*Note*: Due to limitations of PlantUML, all sprites use underscores in place of dashes.  For example, the sprite for "k-proxy" is named "k_proxy".
#+begin_src plantuml :results replace
@startuml
!define k8s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cerebus/k8s-plantuml/master/k8s
!include k8s/common.puml
!include k8s/infrastructure_components/unlabeled/all.puml
!include k8s/control_plane_components/labeled/all.puml

K8S(node1, node, Node 1)
K8S(node2, node, Node 2)

K8S_BOUNDARY(control, control_plane, Control Plane) {
    K8S(api, api, kube-apiserver)
    K8S(cm, c_m, kube-controller-manager)
    K8S(proxy, k_proxy, kube-proxy)
    K8S(sched, sched, kube-scheduler)
}

K8S(etcd, etcd, Etcd)

* Building the sprite library
** Prerequisites
- =rsvg-convert= - Converts SVG to PNG
- =plantuml.jar= - Obviously
- GNU =make=
** Update icons from upstream
[[https://googlecontainertools.github.io/kpt/][kpt]] embeds the upstream SVG files in this repository, under =src/=.  Update these files with the following command.
#+begin_src bash :results silent
kpt pkg update src/@master --strategy force-delete-replace
#+end_src
** Build the library
Set the environment variable =PLANTUML= to your PlantUML installation and run =make=.
#+begin_src bash
PLANTUML=/usr/local/etc/plantuml.jar make
#+end_src
By default, sprites build in the =k8s/= directory but can be overridden with the =DEST= environment variable.
